# Family Business (fambiz)
Family tree maintenance and chart printing.

Since the free family tree programs are weak in chart printing or have other limitations (and I don't like subscribing to the non-free ones) here is an attempt to fill in the gaps.

Capabilities:
- read and write GEDCOM files as used by many other genealogy programs
- visualise and print family tree charts (descendant, ancestor or combined)
- edit and enter people and family relationships

Non-goals:
- research and linkage to the web
- pretty printing
