# Family Business (fambiz)
Family tree maintenance and chart printing.

Since the free family tree programs are weak in chart printing or have other limitations (and I don't like subscribing to the non-free ones) here is an attempt to fill in the gaps.

Capabilities:
- runs on Windows 7-10
- read and write GEDCOM files as used by many other genealogy programs
- edit, visualise and print family tree charts (descendant, ancestor or combined) to any selected number of generations
- save multiple views of tree to GEDCOM file
- output to PDF with custom page size (really just printing to Adobe PDF)
- output to HTML via image and map, for remote web browsing of chart(s), including multiple views linked to each other

Todos:
- support attachment of photos and other media
- disconnect person or branch and reattach elsewhere

Building Fambiz:
- build from solution (.sln) file in VC 2013 or later
- only need fambiz.exe
